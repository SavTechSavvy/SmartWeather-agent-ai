# WeatherSense AI

## Abstract

**WeatherSense AI** is a comprehensive weather prediction and analysis system powered by Azure AI. The project utilizes a suite of Azure AI agents, including custom models, to process and fetch real-time weather data, perform sentiment analysis, and generate health and safety alerts based on weather conditions. With the integration of Azureâ€™s Text Analytics API, WeatherSense AI evaluates the sentiment of weather descriptions, providing users with meaningful insights about the atmosphere, while also ensuring their safety through health advisories.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Weather Forecasting:** Fetch current weather data and 5-day forecasts from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Use Azure AI Text Analytics to perform sentiment analysis on weather descriptions, providing personalized emotional feedback.
- **Health & Safety Alerts:** Generate tailored health advisories based on real-time weather data, such as extreme heat or freezing temperatures.
- **AI Agents:** The project leverages Azure AI agents, like "weather-fetcher" and "data-processor," to handle data processing and weather predictions.
- **Gradio Interface:** A user-friendly web interface where users can input location and email to receive detailed weather reports and visual forecasts.
